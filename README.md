Master Slave JK Flip Flops in Proteus
This project is based upon the circuit that is a two input two output circuit and we can say that is the next version of JK Flip Flops. The circuit can even work well in Race arround conditios of JK Flip Flop. You can check other didgital logic circuits at www.theengineeirngprojects.com
